                <h3>Electrical And Elecronics Engneering Department</h3>
                <p>Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) covers the generation, storage and use of power. We use so many items in our daily life use power (mains, batteries, petrol/ motors or even solar panels). EEE is a very important part of our everyday life. The study of EEE can involve large amounts of power (eg power and control engineering) and large devices (eg power stations and electric vehicles) or small amounts of power (eg computer, communications and information engineering) and small devices (eg MP3 players and cell phones). The vision of this Department is to provide the leadership to enable India's excellence in the field of Electrical Engineering. The Department is committed to advancement of the frontiers of knowledge in Electrical Engineering and to provide the students with a stimulating and rewarding learning experience.</p>
